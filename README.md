# PingPongReinforcementLearning
This repository contains an implementation of Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent to play Atari Pong using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The project follows the classic DQN algorithm introduced by DeepMind and includes improvements such as experience replay and target networks.
